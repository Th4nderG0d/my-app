          Matthew Giles Architects A four bedroom house in London has been
          reimagined by Matthew Giles Architects with an all-natural feel in
          mind, following the owners’ wishes. The project, the transformation of
          a 1960s building, brings light and <br/>serenity into the existing
          structure, which suffered from dark spaces and clutter. Using
          minimalist architecture, light colours and strategic bespoke storage
          solutions the design team has now created a space that is both in tune
          with its residence’s life and better connected with the outdoors areas
          of the property too. Photography: Lorenzo Zandri
